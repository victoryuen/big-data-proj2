## Part 1

### Question

Readin nodes.tsv and edges.tsv. Find ”tsv” is short for Tab Separated Values, where each values (text or numerical values) are separated by a TAB. You can choose the data structure type to store the values (pyspark or pandas).

## Part 2

### Question

For each compound, compute the number of genes that are BIND (CbG) to it using MapReduce method. Output results with top 5 number of genes in a descending order. See example for Figure 1

## Part 3

### Question

For each DISEASE, compute the number of GENE(s) that are UPREGULATES (DuG) using MapReduce method. Output results with the top 5 number of GENE(s) in a descending order. See example for Figure 2.

## Part 5

### Question

For item number 2 to 4 above, compute the hash tables using mid-square method (with r = 3, 4) OR Folding Method (digit-size = 2 and 3). Experiment with 10 hash tables for the selected method. Which method (which digit-size?, r = 3 or r = 4) require least number of storage? Use sys.getsizeof(.) to find the size of the hash tables (10) with its associated link list(s).

Picked Folding Method
